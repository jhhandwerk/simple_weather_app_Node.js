# simple_weather_app_Node.js

A bare-bones weather app I made using Node.js and the OpenWeather API. 
You just need to enter your API key and you are good to go. 

Feel free to style it or add further functionality. Let me know if you have any suggestions for improvements. 

Ready to run as is on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
